            <center><h3> Why? </h3></center>
           <p> Water managers are actively incorporating climate change information into their planning processes.  This supplements traditional planning methods and provides new data and tools to help plan for future change.  However, climate information can be confusing to use and easy to misuse. Advice is not always straightforward and typically requires extended dialogue between information producers and users, which is not always feasible.</p>  
            <p>This collection of Dos and Don'ts aims to increase the utility and appropriate use of climate change information. It pulls together past guidance and experiences to help scientists and water managers learn from each other's efforts and creates a forum for updates as the science and its application evolve.  </p>
