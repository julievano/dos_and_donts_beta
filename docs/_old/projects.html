            <p>The community <a href="{{ "/models" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">  modeling tools </a> and <a href="{{ "/datasets" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"> datasets </a> are useful for applications (for examples see projects below) that evaluate <i> past events </i>, monitor <i>current conditions</i>, predict conditions <i> hours to seasons in advance</i>, and provide possible projections of changes in <i>future years and centuries</i>.  </p>
            <p>The ongoing projects featured below advance our knowledge independent of one another, and collectively provide a strong foundation for understanding and adapting to change.  Importantly, this enables this collection of work to serve multiple needs for a variety of users. Click the links below to learn more.</p>
