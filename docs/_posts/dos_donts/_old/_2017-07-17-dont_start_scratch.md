<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Many resources are available.</p>

<div id="why" class="collapse">
<p>In the past two decades, the number of studies and people working on applying climate change information to water management and planning pas increased (EPA and CWDR 2011; Reclamation 2013). Therefore, those just beginning do not need to start from scratch. There is a steadily growing resource of climate change information, guidance, case studies, and networks to connect to. Increasingly more organizations, both public and private sector, exist that serve to connect practitioners with researchers to generate more decision-relevant information (for example, see the diversity of organizations involved in creating guidance documents in Table 1). These efforts are underway and increasing in many arenas (e.g., public utilities, federal and state agencies, private sector, non-governmental organizations) throughout the world.  Because climate science requires complex models that may not be well-understood by water managers, and climate scientists are unfamiliar with challenges of planning, designing, operating and maintaining water systems, building partnerships, trust, and shared resources between information producers and users is critical, and an increasing number of guidance documents exist on how to effectively foster these partnerships (Jacobs 2002; Ferguson et al. 2014; Addor et al. 2015; Beier et al. 2016).</p>

</a>How to discover who is doing what, where?</h4>
<div id="faq1" class="collapse">
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a global perspective on the state of climate science (IPCC 2014a,b). In the US, the US Global Change Research Program has compiled US-based research by sector and region in the National Climate Assessment (Melillo et al. 2014; NRC 2017).  Other countries have similar national assessments (e.g., Warren and Lemmen 2014). For local-scale studies related to water, the Bureau of Reclamation has three editions of a literature synthesis on climate implications for water and environmental resources that covers 17 western States (Reclamation 2009; 2011b; 2013).  The Climate Change Handbook for Regional Water Planning has a summary of climate change information relevant to integrated regional water management planning (EPA and CWDR 2011), reviewing 167 articles.  The US Army Corp of Engineers has 21 regional reports that summarize hydrological and climate changes and their subsequent impacts on USACE projects (http://www.corpsclimate.us/rccciareport.cfm).</p>
<p>We reference these reports as starting points to navigate to the many universities, national centers, federal, state, and local agencies, and other entities working on these challenges.  The organizations and authors of these reports and the literature they cite provide insights into who is doing what, where.</p>
