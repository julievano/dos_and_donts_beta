Flavio Lehner, Eugene Wahl, Andrew Wood, Douglas Blatchford, & Dagmar Llewellyn's recent paper in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i> uses paleoclimate data to evaluate the role of temperature in streamflow in the Upper Rio Grande River. They found that the runoff ratio - the portion of precipitation that ends up in the river each year, rather than evaporating - is sensitive to high temperatures. This suggests that water managers may be facing lower streamflows than expected during future droughts.
