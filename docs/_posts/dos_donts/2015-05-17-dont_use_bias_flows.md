whyp1: "Raw model output will have biases. Relative differences can help make comparisons more robust.   There are, however, times when relative differences cannot answer the question.  If total magnitudes are required, there are techniques to correct the bias.  Raw model output can be especially problematic if used in reservoir or system operations models."
whyp2: "This DONâ€™T will provide an overview of this challenge and important considerations when bias correcting streamflow."
