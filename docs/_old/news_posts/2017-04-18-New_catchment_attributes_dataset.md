A new paper led by Nans Addor titled "<a href="http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2017-169/"> The CAMELS data set: catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies </a>" is under review in Hydrologic and Earth System Science Discussions. It describes an extensive effort to compile catchment attributes and assess their quality for the large-sample basin dataset compiled by Newman et al. 2015. These datasets will be useful tools for large-sample comparative hydrological studies.
