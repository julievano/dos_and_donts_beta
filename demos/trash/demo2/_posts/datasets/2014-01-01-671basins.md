This project developed basin scale hydrometeorological forcing data for 671 basins in the United States Geological Survey's Hydro-Climatic Data Network 2009 (HCDN-2009, Lins 2012) conterminous U.S. basin subset. Retrospective model forcings are derived from Daymet, NLDAS, and Maurer et al. (2002) Daymet forcing data run from 1 Jan 1980 to 31 Dec 2012, NLDAS and Maurer run from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2008. USGS streamflow data are provided for all basins for all dates available in the 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2012 period. Daymet, NLDAS forcing and USGS streamflow data will be extended through 31 December 2014 by the end of 2015. More information at: http://ral.ucar.edu/projects/hap/flowpredict/subpages/modelvar.php.
