The CMIP3 ensemble, released in 2011, was based on 112 climate projections downscaled to 1/8Â° latitude-longitude across the contiguous U.S. using the Bias-Correction and Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) technique. These downscaled climate projections were then translated into hydrologic projections over only the Western U.S.. The CMIP5 ensemble are also downscaled using BCSD and then translated into hydrology using similar, yet updated, methods that were expanded to include the full contiguous U.S..  Even though there was 231 BCSD5 climate projections, hydrologic modeling practicalities limited the scope to a subset of 97  projections representing 31 CMIP5 climate models and 4 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.
