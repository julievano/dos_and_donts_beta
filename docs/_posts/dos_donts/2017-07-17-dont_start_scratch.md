<div id="demo" class="collapse">
In the past two decades, the number of studies and people working on applying climate change information to water management and planning has increased (EPA and CWDR 2011; Reclamation 2013). Therefore, those just beginning do not need to start from scratch. There is a steadily growing resource of climate change information, guidance, case studies, and networks to connect to. Increasingly more organizations, both public and private sector, exist that serve to connect practitioners with researchers to generate more decision-relevant information (for example, see the diversity of organizations involved in creating guidance documents in Table 1). These efforts are underway and increasing in many arenas (e.g., public utilities, federal and state agencies, private sector, non-governmental organizations) throughout the world.  Because climate science requires complex models that may not be well-understood by water managers, and climate scientists are unfamiliar with challenges of planning, designing, operating and maintaining water systems, building partnerships, trust, and shared resources between information producers and users is critical, and an increasing number of guidance documents exist on how to effectively foster these partnerships (Jacobs 2002; Ferguson et al. 2014; Addor et al. 2015; Beier et al. 2016).
