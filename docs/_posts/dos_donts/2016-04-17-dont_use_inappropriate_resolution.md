whyp1: "Realistic representations of climate and hydrology are often dependent on spatial and temporal resolution.  While finer-resolution information is often desired, and the goal of much research, highly-localized climate data may not be appropriate or possible. Climate downscaling approaches transform model resolutions from coarse to finer scales, with an aim of making global information more useful to local-scale planning." 
whyp2: "This DON'T will provide considerations for determining approaches more relevant to particular impacts and geographies, including cautions on limitations for information producers and users."
