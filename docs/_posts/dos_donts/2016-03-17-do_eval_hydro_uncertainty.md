whyp1: "Hydrology models represent hydrologic processes useful in understanding how much and at what time water from rain and snow end up in rivers and streams.  They also provide a better understanding of soil moisture and snow pack conditions.  They do this in a variety of ways using different process equations, spatial structures, model configurations, and parameters which can influence model results.  Therefore, consideration should be given as to how appropriate certain models are at answering certain questions.  A single simulation provides information, but does not capture hydrologic uncertainties."

whyp2: "This DO will provide insights into these uncertainties and how to explore them along with suggestions for how to better navigate hydrology model possibilities."
