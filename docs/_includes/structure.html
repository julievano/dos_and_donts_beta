<p> Verison 1.0 focuses on Study Design (currently in review in <i>Climate Services</i>).  Model Selection guidelines are being drafted and will consitute the majority of updates for version 2.0, coming soon.  Data Interpretation are conceptulized and will be the next focus area. </p>
<p> Each Do or Don't contains: (1) explanations for why it is important, (2) frequently asked questions by information users and/or case study examples, and (3) recommended paths forward. This framework serves as a foundation for further refinement which can promote dialogue between information producers and users.</p>
