whyp1: "Realistic representations of climate and hydrology depend on the appropriateness of the spatial and temporal resolutions used.  While finer-resolution information is often desired, highly-localized climate data may not be appropriate or possible. This is because information (e.g., observations) may be lacking, but it may also be a matter of making appropriate tradeoffs. Increasing resolution to better resolve local-scale features (e.g., capture processes that relate to finer-scale topography) requires considerably more computing resources, which limits the amount of other evaluations possible. In other words, finer resolution has an opportunity cost that should be considered."

whyp2: "This DON'T will provide considerations for determining approaches more relevant to particular impacts and geographies, including cautions on limitations for information producers and users."
