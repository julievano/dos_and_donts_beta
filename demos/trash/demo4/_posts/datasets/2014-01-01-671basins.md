This project developed basin scale hydrometeorological forcing data for 671 basins in the United States Geological Survey's Hydro-Climatic Data Network 2009 (HCDN-2009, Lins 2012) conterminous U.S. basin subset using the Geospatial Fabric developed by the Modeling of Watersheds (MoWs) group in the USGS (Viger et al. 2014). Retrospective model forcings are derived from Daymet, NLDAS, and Maurer et al. (2002).  Update to version 1.2 has extended Daymet and NLDAS forcing data to run from 1 Jan 1980 to 31 Dec 2014. Corresponding calibrated Snow-17/SAC/UH model output for Daymet and NLDAS has also been updated to run through 31 Dec 2014.  Maurer data run from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2008. USGS streamflow data are provided for all basins for all dates available in the 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2014 period. More information at: http://ral.ucar.edu/projects/hap/flowpredict/subpages/modelvar.php.
