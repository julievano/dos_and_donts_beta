     <center><p> DOS and DON'TS are currently divided into three categories:  </p></center>
     <div class="row">
     <div class="col-xs-offset-3 col-sm-offset-4 col-md-offset-4 col-lg-offset-5"> 
     <p>1. Study Design </p>  
     <p>2. Model Selection </p>
     <p>3. Data Interpretation</p>
     </div>
     </div> 
<p> Version 1.0 focuses on Study Design (currently in review in <i>Climate Services</i>).  Model Selection guidelines are being drafted and will consitute the majority of updates for version 2.0, coming soon.  Data Interpretation guidelines are conceptulized and will be a future focus area as resources allow. </p>
<p> Each DO or DON'T contains: (1) explanations for why it is important, (2) frequently asked questions by information users and/or case study examples, and (3) recommended paths forward. This framework serves as a foundation for further refinement which can promote dialogue between those who produce the information and those who use it. We use references throughout; the full citations of which can be found under <a href={{ "/foundations/#references" | prepend: site.baseurl }}>FOUNDATIONS</a>.</p>
<p> These are general guidelines intended to promote better understanding. We recognize there are usually exceptions to every rule.  However, without defining rules, we canâ€™t define exceptions.  We discuss exceptions in our explanation and welcome suggestions for additions and further clarifications (continue scrolling down or click <a href="#participation">here</a> to learn more about joining the conversation).
