A new project, <i> Identifying Sources of Uncertainty in Flood Frequency Analyses</i>, is now underway.  Andrew Newman will lead an effort, working closely with the Bureau of Reclamation, to improve our understanding of uncertainities associated with large flood estimates.  The team will examine hydrologic model structure and parameterization for locations critical to Reclamation's operations.
