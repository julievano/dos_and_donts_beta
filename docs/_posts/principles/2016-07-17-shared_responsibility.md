Scientists who study climate impacts must continuously strive to place new results in context and quantify and document uncertainty in ways that are relevant to (and informed by) the decision requirements and tools being handled by users. Simultaneously, and in collaboration with scientists, water managers must continue to grabble with the nature of the uncertainties, connect these to risk appropriately, and integrate this informed perspective into their planning process.  

More details included in version 2.0, coming soon...
