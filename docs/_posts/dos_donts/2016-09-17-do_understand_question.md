whyp1: "Before diving into the details of model selection, it is important to know the questions the climate change study is asking. This will help determine the level of detail that fits oneâ€™s needs and resources and define evaluation criteria beforehand.  Then model selection can proceed by identifying models at each link in the modeling chain (along with resolution and number of realizations) appropriate to capture the climate change response of the variables needed to answer the questions. Some model experiments are appropriate and reliable for certain questions but not others.  Knowing this ahead of time can save time and agony."
